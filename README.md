# Print Name in Programming Languages
I have taken the liberty of writing same programme (a programme that prints my name) in different programming languages. Each programming language used has a separate file with different extension name e.g '.js', '.py', '.c', '.php'

## Documentation
You can find the official documentation of each programming language used in the list below;
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/)
* [C](https://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/pdf/libc.pdf)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/docs.php)

### Usage
Each of the scripts require respective development environment to run properly and you can find this by following the official documentation listed above in documentation section. 

For the C variation of the programme, there is an executble file alredy generated for it, you can run this file if you have a C compiler (e.g gcc) installed on your computer by running the following code on your terminal;

`./print` or `print`
